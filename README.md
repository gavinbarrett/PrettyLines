I became frustrated with existing programs with similar functionality. Programs such as diff that printed mismatching lines seemed to only detect which lines differed. This made it really difficult to check long lines for slight differences; I wanted a program that would highlight the different characters within two lines of a file. This program prints out the lines of two files and highlights their differences.
